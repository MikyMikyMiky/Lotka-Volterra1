# Lotka-Volterra1
The simulation of Lotka-Volterra competition model with restrained population capacity
It was made during 6th term of my education in MIREA. The main purpose of this simulation was to graph the dependencies of various characteristics (e.g. time until extinction, mean population number) and model parameters (birth, death and competition).
