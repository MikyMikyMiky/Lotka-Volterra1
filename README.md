# Lotka-Volterra1
The simulation of Lotka-Volterra competition model with restrained population capacity.

It was made during the 6th term of my education in MIREA. The main purpose of this simulation was to graph the dependencies between model parameters (birth, death and competition) and various characteristics (e.g. time until extinction, mean population number).
